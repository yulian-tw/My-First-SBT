#### Bootstrap with SBT ?

This repo is setup by following [sbt by example](https://www.scala-sbt.org/1.x/docs/sbt-by-example.html). See: [scala-de201](https://github.com/yulian-tw/Scala-DE201) to bootstrap with `sbt new` command.

### Using Scala 3.x with Apache Spark ?

Scala 2.13 was released in June 2019, but it took more than two years and a huge effort by the Spark maintainers for 
the first Scala 2.13-compatible Spark release (Spark 3.2.0) to arrive. [Using Scala 3 with Spark (47deg, 2022)](
